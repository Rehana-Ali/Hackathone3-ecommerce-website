 Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025 - Day 2: Architecting the Future
Hey, Hackathon fam! 👋 Day 2 was all about strategic moves—designing the system architecture, defining integration flows, and setting the foundation for a seamless marketplace. Let’s dive in!

🏗️ System Architecture: The Blueprint
The goal? Scalable, efficient, and intuitive.

Frontend: Built with Next.js, styled with Tailwind CSS, powered by ShadCN UI components. State managed via Zustand for sleek performance.
Backend: Sanity.io as the CMS powerhouse, connected with robust API routes.
Data Flow: RESTful API calls handling CRUD operations like a charm—GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
🌐 Third-Party API Magic
To level up, I’m integrating a third-party API for:
💳 Payment Processing | 📦 Product Availability

🔑 How It Works:

Frontend → Backend: Sends user actions as API requests.
Backend → Third-Party API: Processes, authenticates (via API keys + HTTPS), and fetches data.
Response Loop: Data flows back to the frontend to update the UI in real time.
🚀 API Routes in Action
GET /api/products → Fetch all products
POST /api/order → Create a new order (linked with the payment gateway)
GET /api/order/:id → Retrieve specific order details
PUT /api/order/:id → Update order status (e.g., Shipped, Delivered)
GET /api/payment/verify → Secure payment verification
🛠️ Tech Stack Snapshot
Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, Zustand
Backend: Sanity.io
Auth: Clerk for secure logins
Third-Party API: Handling payments + inventory
🔗 What’s Next?
Implement API routes
Integrate third-party services
Begin frontend development to connect the dots
✨ Day 2 Wins:
✅ System design crafted
✅ API structure defined
✅ Third-party integration planned

Let’s turn this architecture into a living, breathing marketplace. On to Day 3! 🚀
