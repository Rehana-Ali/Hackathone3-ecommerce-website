Day 3 Recap: API Integration & Data Migration

🎯 Objective

The goal for Day 3 was to integrate an external API and migrate product data into Sanity CMS, building a dynamic, scalable marketplace backend. This involved:

Connecting to external APIs

Migrating and transforming data

Updating schemas

Ensuring seamless frontend rendering

🛠️ Key Steps

1️⃣ Understanding the API

API Endpoint: https://hackathon-apis.vercel.app/api/products

Provided data: Products, Categories, Images

Tools: Postman (for testing and validating responses)

2️⃣ Backend Setup

Libraries Used:

axios → Fetch API data

next-sanity → Interact with Sanity CMS

slugify → Generate clean, SEO-friendly slugs

3️⃣ Schema Updates in Sanity

Product Schema: Added fields like tags, dimensions, category

Category Schema: Created to manage product categories

Relationships: Linked products with categories via reference fields

4️⃣ Data Migration Process

Fetching Data: Retrieved API data with axios

Image Upload: Uploaded images to Sanity using the asset manager

Data Transformation: Mapped API fields to match Sanity's schema

Import: Used createOrReplace to insert data into Sanity

🛡️ Error Handling

Implemented try-catch blocks for robust error management

Logged errors for easy debugging

5️⃣ Frontend Integration

Created reusable functions to fetch data:

getAllProducts → Retrieve all products

getPopularProducts → Fetch featured items

getProductBySlug → Get product details via slugs

Rendered and verified data on the frontend

⚡ Challenges & Solutions

Large Image FilesChallenge: Slow uploads due to file sizeSolution: Utilized Sanity's asset manager with buffer support

Schema MismatchesChallenge: API fields didn't align with Sanity schemaSolution: Adjusted schemas and mapped fields during transformation

Data IntegrityChallenge: Risk of data loss during migrationSolution: Added validation checks for completeness before import

🚀 Performance Optimizations

Batched API Requests: Prevent rate limiting

Caching: Improved performance for frequently accessed data

Optimized Queries: Limited fields to reduce payload size

✅ Results

Products & Categories: Successfully imported into Sanity CMS

Verification: Confirmed data accuracy in Sanity Studio

Frontend: Dynamic product display verified and functional

📈 Future Improvements

Automate schema validation to prevent mismatches

Implement detailed logging for better error tracking

Enable real-time syncing with Sanity webhooks

🚀 Running the Migration Script

Prerequisites:

Node.js installed

Sanity project connected

External API accessible

Steps:

# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the migration script
node scripts/importData.js

Verify:

Open Sanity Studio to confirm imported data

Check the frontend for accurate product listings

🎯 Conclusion

Day 3 marked a significant milestone, successfully integrating external APIs with Sanity CMS. The process ensured data integrity, optimized performance, and prepared the marketplace for dynamic growth and future scalability.

Built with performance. Designed for scalability. 🌟
